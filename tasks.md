## üèóÔ∏è Secure Desktop AI App - Master Plan

### Epic 1: Project Foundation & Authentication (Week 1)
- [x] Initialize Git repository for version control.
- [x] Set up a new Electron application.
- [x] Find and integrate a suitable Electron + Supabase boilerplate for authentication.
- [x] Configure Supabase Auth for user sign-up (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone) and login.
- [x] Create a `profiles` table in Supabase to store user data.

### Epic 2: Payment & Session Management (Week 2)
- [x] Select and integrate a payment provider (e.g., Stripe) with Supabase.
- [x] Create the payment UI where users can pay the $15 fee.
- [x] Implement a `sessions` table in Supabase to track payments and activation status.
- [x] Build the logic to "start" a session and enforce the 24-hour time limit.

### Epic 3: Core Application Integration (Week 3)
- [x] Integrate your existing UI for the LLM interaction.
- [x] Implement the LLM logic in the `chat` Edge Function.
- [x] Implement the screen capture functionality.
- [x] Implement the audio recording and transcription functionality.

### Epic 4: Security & Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [x] Implement screen sharing protection to hide the app window.
- [x] **CRITICAL: Hybrid Security Implementation - Zero Exposed Keys**
  - [x] Create custom secure authentication endpoints (auth-signup, auth-login)
  - [x] Implement secure database access endpoint (secure-db)
  - [x] Replace client-side Supabase with secure custom client
  - [x] All operations now go through authenticated backend endpoints
  - [x] Zero API keys exposed in downloadable client code
  - [x] Maximum security architecture implemented

### Epic 5: Packaging & Distribution (Week 5)
- [x] Configure the application for building and packaging (macOS, Windows).
- [x] **Debug LLM Response Issue**
  - [x] Fixed development mode authentication in chat Edge Function
  - [x] Updated main.ts to use mock tokens in development mode
  - [x] Verified authentication flow works for both development and production modes
- [x] **Implement Admin System**
  - [x] Created `admin_users` table in Supabase database
  - [x] Added `srikarv526@gmail.com` as admin user
  - [x] Created `check-admin` Edge Function for admin validation
  - [x] Updated chat Edge Function to bypass payment for admin users
  - [x] Updated main.ts to use database admin checks instead of hardcoded values
  - [x] Admin accounts now automatically skip payment and get unlimited access
- [ ] **CURRENT: Complete End-to-End Testing**
  - [ ] Test admin login with srikarv526@gmail.com / Amma@12345678
  - [ ] Verify admin bypasses payment and goes directly to main app
  - [ ] Test LLM chat functionality with admin account
  - [ ] Verify screen capture functionality works
  - [ ] Test audio recording and transcription
  - [ ] Ensure all features work for admin users
- [ ] Implement an auto-update mechanism to deliver new versions to users.
- [ ] Final testing and preparation for launch.
